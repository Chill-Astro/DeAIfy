! DeAIfy - EXTREME by Chill-Astro Software.
! This filter aims to block a broader range of AI websites, including those with potential for harmful applications.
! It is NOT exhaustive and requires ongoing review and manual additions/removals based on your specific definition of "harmful AI" and new emerging threats.

! --- AI Scam/Phishing Related (general purpose, if you want to be extremely cautious) ---
! These are difficult to block directly as they are often hosted on compromised sites or appear briefly.
! Blocking general AI content generation might indirectly help, but dedicated cybersecurity is better here.
! You might consider blocking known scam reporting sites to avoid accidentally landing on them if they link to actual scams.
! No specific domains are listed here as "scam AI websites" are highly ephemeral.

! --- AI-driven Content Moderation/Censorship Tools (if you oppose their use or specific companies) ---
! (These are often B2B services, so direct website blocking might not impact end-user experience significantly)
||activefence.com^$document
||cogito.com^$document
||pureweb.com^$document

! --- Specific AI Directories/Marketplaces known for promoting controversial tools ---
! (These are less about the AI itself and more about the aggregation)
! Adding a few more general AI directories if you want to limit discovery

||therundown.ai^$document
||ainews.com^$document

! --- Websites and Platforms for AI-Generated Harmful Content (e.g., non-consensual deepfakes, hate speech) ---
! This is extremely hard to filter by domain alone, as such content often appears on large social media platforms or
! obscure corners of the internet. Dedicated deepfake detection tools or reporting mechanisms are more effective.
! Examples below are very general and often not actual direct hosts of illegal content.
! Specific subreddits or image boards often host such content, but blocking entire platforms is too broad.
! If a specific known site is repeatedly abused, you can add it.
! Example: If a specific image board is frequently linked to abusive AI content:
! ||4chan.org/pol/^$document (This would block the /pol/ board on 4chan, but 4chan hosts many boards)
! Use with extreme caution and only if you know exactly what you are blocking and why.
! It's generally better to block specific *elements* on such sites if they are the source of the problem.

! --- Experimental or Research AI Websites with high-risk potential (e.g., autonomous agents, if accessible to public) ---
! These are often university or research lab sites, so general blocking is not advisable.
! Only block if a specific project or publicly accessible demo is deemed harmful.
